The code in this repo is based on the excellent box2D-actionscript tutorials
at http://www.kerp.net/box2d/index.php

The enclosed box2d-haxe port is from http://code.google.com/p/box2d-haxe/. I
have packaged so that it can be installed locally via haxelib. 
Run 'haxelib test box2d-haxelib.zip'
You will also need the 'TweenerHX' library, which is available from the
central haxelib repository.
